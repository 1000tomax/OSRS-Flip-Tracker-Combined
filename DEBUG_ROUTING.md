# Routing Debug Checklist

## Current Issue

Routes `/heatmap`, `/efficiency`, and `/test` are all showing the home page
instead of their respective components.

## What We've Tried

1. ✅ Created analytics components (TradingHeatMap, CapitalEfficiency)
2. ✅ Added routes to App.jsx
3. ✅ Updated navigation links
4. ✅ Fixed missing formatGP export
5. ✅ Simplified route paths (removed /analytics/ prefix)
6. ✅ Changed from lazy loading to direct imports
7. ✅ Created TestRoute component for debugging

## Server Status

- Running on http://localhost:3001
- No build errors
- HMR working

## Next Steps to Try

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify React Router v7 syntax compatibility
3. Test if other existing routes (like /items, /charts) work
4. Check if the catch-all route `<Route path="*" element={<Home />} />` is
   intercepting everything
5. Try removing the catch-all route temporarily
6. Consider downgrading React Router to v6 if v7 has breaking changes
7. Add console.log to App.jsx to see if routes are being matched

## Files Modified

- src/App.jsx - Added new routes
- src/components/Navigation.jsx - Added new nav items
- src/pages/TradingHeatMap.jsx - New heat map page
- src/pages/CapitalEfficiency.jsx - New efficiency page
- src/pages/TestRoute.jsx - Debug test route
- src/utils/formatGP.js - New utility for formatting GP values
- All components in src/components/analytics/

## Quick Test

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
window.location.pathname;
```

Should show the current route. If it shows `/heatmap` but displays home content,
it's a React Router issue.
