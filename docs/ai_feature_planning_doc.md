# AI Conversational Querying Feature - Planning Document

## üéØ Overview

Implementation of an AI-powered conversational querying system for the OSRS 1K to Max Cash flipping dashboard. This feature will allow users to ask natural language questions about flipping data and receive intelligent analysis, charts, and insights.

## üí° Core Concept

**Problem:** OSRS flipping generates infinite specific questions that would be impossible to build dedicated UI for.

**Solution:** AI-powered natural language querying that can analyze raw flipping data and provide custom insights.

**Example Queries:**
- "What's my best performing item on weekends?"
- "Show me all flips over 100K profit in the last 30 days"
- "If I had 20M cash stack, which items should I focus on?"
- "Compare my Dragon item performance vs Barrows items this month"

## üî• Killer Use Cases

### 1. Community Debate Resolution
**The High-Volume vs High-Value Debate:**
- Query: "If I had not flipped any high volume items and only did high value items, would I have made more money?"
- AI analyzes actual flipping data to provide counterfactual analysis
- Settles community debates with real data, not theory

### 2. Cash-Stack Specific Advice
**Personalized Recommendations:**
- Query: "My cash stack is 15M, should I focus only on high-value items?"
- AI provides analysis specific to that cash stack level using historical performance data
- Perfect for educating new flippers with relevant, data-backed advice

## üõ† Technical Implementation

### API Selection
**Recommended: OpenAI GPT-4**
- **Pros:** Mature ecosystem, good data analysis, reasonable pricing, reliable uptime
- **Cons:** Can hallucinate numbers, shorter context than alternatives
- **Alternatives:** Claude (better analysis, more expensive), Gemini (cheaper, less reliable)

### Architecture Flow
```
User Query ‚Üí Data Preprocessing ‚Üí AI Analysis ‚Üí Response Processing ‚Üí Display
```

### Data Strategy
**Smart Data Selection:**
- Pre-aggregate data by time periods and cash stack ranges
- Send only relevant subset to AI to manage context limits
- Include OSRS context in system prompts

### Response Formats
**Structured AI Responses:**
```json
{
  "analysis": "Text explanation of findings",
  "chartData": [...], // Chart-ready data
  "chartType": "line|bar|pie",
  "title": "Chart title",
  "confidence": "high|medium|low",
  "dataPoints": 150 // Number of flips analyzed
}
```

## üí∞ Monetization & Cost Management

### Freemium Model
- **Free Tier:** 5 queries per user (cookie-based tracking)
- **Premium:** Unlimited queries via donation
- **Transparent Pricing:** Clear explanation that AI APIs cost money
- **Donation Link:** Remove limits after contribution

### Cost Optimization Strategies
1. **Smart Caching:** Cache results by query hash for identical questions
2. **Dynamic Chart Rendering:** AI returns chart data, frontend renders
3. **Query Analytics:** Track expensive/popular queries for optimization
4. **Rate Limiting:** Prevent abuse with IP-based limits

## üìä Query Analytics & Feature Evolution

### Track Everything
- Query text and patterns
- Response quality and user satisfaction
- API costs per query type
- Success/failure rates
- Popular time periods and data ranges

### AI ‚Üí Traditional UI Pipeline
**Process:**
1. Query gets asked frequently (20+ times)
2. AI handles it well (high success rate)
3. Build dedicated chart/filter for it
4. Future users get instant results

**Benefits:**
- Crowd-source feature roadmap
- Convert expensive AI calls to free, instant features
- Identify what the community actually cares about

## üéØ User Experience Design

### Query Interface
- **Prominent placement** on dashboard
- **Example prompts** to guide users
- **Auto-complete** for item names and common patterns
- **Query templates** for common analysis types

### Loading & Feedback
- **Loading states** for 3-10 second AI response times
- **Progressive disclosure** - show text analysis first, then charts
- **Response validation** against actual data
- **Clear disclaimers** about AI analysis limitations

### Results Display
- **Text analysis** with key insights highlighted
- **Interactive charts** when applicable
- **Share functionality** for Discord/community sharing
- **Follow-up suggestions** for related queries

## üöÄ Community Impact

### Educational Value
- **Data-driven insights** to settle community debates
- **Personalized advice** based on actual performance data
- **Teaching moments** - turn bad queries into educational examples

### Community Features
- **Community Insights** showcase (with permission)
- **Query leaderboard** - most interesting questions of the week
- **Integration with Flipping Copilot Discord** for sharing analyses

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Challenges

### Technical Challenges
1. **Data Context Size:** Large datasets may exceed AI context limits
2. **AI Understanding:** Need to teach AI about OSRS flipping mechanics
3. **Cost Control:** Complex analysis can be expensive
4. **Data Accuracy:** AI might hallucinate numbers or misinterpret data

### Solutions
- **Data preprocessing** and smart summarization
- **OSRS knowledge base** in system prompts
- **Hard usage limits** and query optimization
- **Response validation** and clear disclaimers

### Additional Considerations
- **Mobile optimization** for AI-generated charts
- **Data privacy** and anonymization
- **EU compliance** for international users
- **Fallback handling** when AI services are down

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Multi-query conversations** - follow-up questions in context
- **Scheduled analysis** - weekly/monthly automated insights
